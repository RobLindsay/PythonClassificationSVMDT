The submitted Python code was written in jupyter notebook.  
The code should be opened in jupyter notebook with the attached data document in the same folder.
The data document is called "SeoulBikeData.csv"
The document is slightly modified to remove special characters from the header of the original data file.  

Once the Python code has been opened in Jupyter Notebook, simply run all.  

Please note that some examples in my report are generated by manually changing variables.  
The most notable instance is where I change the target variable from median to mean.  
If you would like to do this yourself, it takes place in two different sections of the code.  

FIRST LOCATION For SVM data is in the code following the markdown "Introduce Target Variable".
There are two instances of .median() in the top two lines of code that would just need to be changed to .mean()

SECOND LOCATION For Decision Tree Data, the code is located past the "Part 2 - Decision Tree" markdown 
It is between the "Check ... linearity in Seasons" and "Decision Tree w/out paramaters, no CV" markdowns
Again, there are two instances.  

There are other instances in the report that reference changes such as rerunning with the original code.  
I did not include those instances but do have seperate files containing the changes and can provide as needed.
